    "#### In this tutorial we will overwrite a feature layer that was created in an ArcGIS Pro project. In ArcGIS Pro, the layer was first created using data from a connected MSSQL database table. The layer was then shared through ArcGIS Pro to ArcGIS Online (AGO). The MSSQL table regularly updates and we want to reflect those updates on the shared feature layer. Here we will set up a script that overwrites the feature layer with new sql table updates. After your finished making the script, use windows task scheduler to regulaly run this script and update your AGO feature layer. Click and scroll down to [\"Create and Schedule a Task\"](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/schedule-automated-near-real-time-data-updates/) for more information and Windows task scheduler."
